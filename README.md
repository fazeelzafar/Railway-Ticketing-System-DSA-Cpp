# Railway-Ticketing-System-DSA-Cpp

This is basic project which I made using DSA concepts based on C++. I made this in 3rd semester of my university.
This project provides the basic ability to reserve, modify and delete tickets. There are 2 modules in this project, a user and an module, both having a seperate login.
The user can book tickets, pay for them and print them while the admin can delete or modify them, as well as modify the details of the user.

The concepts used in this projects are:
 -Linked List
 -Searching & Sorting Algorithms
